        "\n",
        "- **T-test:** A t-test is used when you are comparing the means of two groups or testing a sample mean against a known population mean, and you don't know the population standard deviation. It's typically used with small sample sizes (typically less than 30) and assumes the data follows a normal distribution. For example, you might use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two different classes of students (Class A vs. Class B).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Z-test:** A z-test is used when you have a larger sample size (typically over 30) and you know the population standard deviation. It assumes a normal distribution and is often used for hypothesis testing with large datasets. For instance, you might use a z-test to assess if the mean height of a sample of adults matches the known population mean height.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example scenario:\n",
        "Suppose you want to determine if a new drug reduces blood pressure compared to a standard treatment. If you have data from a small clinical trial with less than 30 patients in each group and don't know the population standard deviation, you'd use a t-test. If you have data from a large-scale study with more than 30 patients in each group and you know the population standard deviation, you'd use a z-test.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q2: One-tailed vs. Two-tailed tests:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **One-tailed test:** In a one-tailed test, you're interested in a specific direction of an effect or difference. For example, you want to know if a new drug is more effective (not just different) than the old drug. This means you're only looking at one side of the distribution curve. One-tailed tests are more powerful in detecting effects in one direction but can miss effects in the opposite direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Two-tailed test:** In a two-tailed test, you're interested in whether there's a significant difference or effect in either direction. For example, you want to know if a new drug is different from the old drug, but you're not specifying if it's better or worse. Two-tailed tests are more conservative and are used when you want to detect any significant difference, regardless of direction.\n",

        "## Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Type 1 error (False Positive):** This occurs when you reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. In other words, you conclude that there is a significant effect when there isn't one. An example could be a medical test incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having a disease.\n",

        "- **Type 2 error (False Negative):** This occurs when you fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false.

        "\n",
        "Bayes's Theorem is a mathematical formula that calculates the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It's particularly useful in conditional probability situations. The formula is:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   - \\(P(A)\\) is the prior probability of having the condition.\n",
        "   - \\(P(B|A)\\) is the probability of testing positive if you have the condition.\n",
        "   - \\(P(B)\\) is the overall probability of testing positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Bayes's Theorem helps you update your probability estimate (P(A)) based on new information (the positive test result, P(B|A)) and the background probability of getting a positive test result (P(B)).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q5: Confidence interval and calculation with an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence). It's used to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating population parameters from a sample.\n",

        "Example: Suppose you want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height of a population, and you have a random sample of 100 individuals with a sample mean of 65 inches and a sample standard deviation of 3 inches. You also have a z-table or calculator that gives you the critical z-value for a 95% confidence level, which is approximately 1.96.\n",
