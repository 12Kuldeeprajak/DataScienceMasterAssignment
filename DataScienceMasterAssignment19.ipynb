        "1. `head()` and `tail()`: These functions allow you to view the first few rows (`head()`) or the last few rows (`tail()`) of a DataFrame. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure and content of a DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `info()`: This function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of rows and columns, column names, data types, and memory usage. It helps in understanding the overall structure of the DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `describe()`: This function generates descriptive statistics of the numerical columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values. It provides insights into the distribution and summary statistics of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `sort_values()`: This function allows you to sort the DataFrame based on one or more columns. You can specify the column(s) to sort by and whether to sort in ascending or descending order. It is helpful when you want to order the data based on certain criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `drop()`: This function allows you to remove specific rows or columns from the DataFrame. You can specify the labels of the rows or columns you want to drop, along with the axis parameter (0 for rows, 1 for columns). It is useful for excluding irrelevant or duplicate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. `fillna()`: This function helps in filling missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a method such as forward-fill or backward-fill. It enables you to handle missing data and ensure the integrity of the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. `groupby()`: This function enables grouping of data based on one or more columns, allowing you to perform aggregation operations on subsets of the data. You can apply functions like sum, mean, count, etc., to the grouped data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. `merge()`: This function allows you to combine multiple DataFrames based on common columns or indices. It is useful when you need to join or merge data from different sources or perform relational database-like operations.\n",
