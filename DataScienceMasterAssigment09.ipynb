        "1. **Consistency and Compatibility:** Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception follows the same structure and behavior as other built-in exceptions in Python. It allows your custom exception to be compatible with existing exception handling mechanisms and conventions.\n",

        "3. **Exception Handling:** Inheriting from the Exception class allows you to handle your custom exception in a general catch-all manner by catching the Exception base class itself. It provides a consistent way to handle all exceptions, including your custom exception, in a single except block.\n",
        "\n",

        "4. Avoid catching and ignoring exceptions: Avoid catching exceptions without providing any meaningful error handling or logging. Ignoring exceptions can lead to hidden bugs and make troubleshooting and debugging difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Use finally block for cleanup: Use the finally block to execute cleanup code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It is useful for releasing resources, closing files, or cleaning up database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Avoid unnecessary exception handling: Avoid using exceptions for flow control or normal program behavior. Exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions or error situations, not as a regular control mechanism.\n",

        "7. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Handle exceptions at the level where you can effectively handle or recover from them. Let exceptions propagate up the call stack when they cannot be appropriately handled at a particular level.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Log exceptions: Include logging statements in your exception handling code to provide meaningful information about the exception, such as the error message, traceback, and relevant context. Logging helps in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues.\n",

        "10. Test exception handling: Test your code for expected exception handling behavior. Ensure that exceptions are raised and caught correctly, and that the appropriate actions are taken in response to each exception."
